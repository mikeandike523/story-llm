1. The maximum size of a Flatland inhabitant is about twelve inches, with women being straight lines and lower-class men being isosceles triangles.  
2. The middle class in Flatland consists of equilateral triangles, while professional men and gentlemen are squares or pentagons, and the nobility are polygons with increasing numbers of sides, eventually becoming circles.  
3. In Flatland, each male child is born with one more side than his father, except for tradesmen, soldiers, and workmen, whose offspring generally remain in their class unless they show exceptional intelligence and have arranged marriages.  
4. A true equilateral triangle born from isosceles parents is celebrated and adopted by an equilateral family to prevent regression to its original class.  
5. The emergence of an equilateral from lower classes is welcomed as it prevents revolution by offering hope to the serfs and maintaining the aristocratic order.  
6. The Law of Compensation ensures that as lower classes gain intelligence, their acute angles decrease, making them less physically threatening, thus maintaining social order.  
7. The aristocracy uses this natural law and additional measures to quell rebellions, with potential leaders either integrated into higher classes or neutralized, leading to the failure of all recorded uprisings.
