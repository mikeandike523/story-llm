1. On the eve of the year 2000, the narrator dreams of a world called Lineland, inhabited by beings who only perceive existence in a single straight line.
2. The narrator encounters a multitude of small Straight Lines and Points, assuming them to be the inhabitants of Lineland, all moving uniformly with a noise of chirping.
3. Attempting to communicate with what he believes to be a Woman, the narrator is surprised to learn that the entity is the Monarch of Lineland, who perceives his straight line as the entire world.
4. The Monarch explains that he and his subjects are confined to a single line, without the ability to see or move beyond it, perceiving only points and relying on sound for interaction.
5. Despite the monotony of their existence, the Monarch and his subjects are cheerful, and the narrator inquires about their family life, puzzled by how they can marry and have children without proximity.
6. The Monarch explains that marriages in Lineland are consummated through sound, with every man having two voices, and that each man is naturally wed to two women to achieve harmonious union.
7. The Monarch describes a weekly ritual where rhythmic motion and a marriage chorus allow inhabitants to find their mates through sound, resulting in triplet offspring to maintain balance.
8. The process of finding a perfect vocal match is often lengthy, with repeated attempts allowing individuals to gradually harmonize until a perfect union is achieved, culminating in marriage and the birth of three children.
