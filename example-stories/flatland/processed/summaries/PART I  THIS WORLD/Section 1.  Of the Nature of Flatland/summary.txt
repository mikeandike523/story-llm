1. The narrator refers to their world as Flatland and describes it as a two-dimensional plane where geometric figures move freely but cannot rise or sink, much like shadows with luminous edges.
2. In Flatland, inhabitants cannot perceive the shapes of figures as humans in Space can, and only see them as straight lines due to their two-dimensional perspective.
3. The narrator uses the example of viewing a penny from the edge of a table to explain how objects in Flatland appear as straight lines, similar to how distant lands appear as lines to sailors on the horizon.
4. In Flatland, without a sun or shadows, inhabitants see figures as straight lines that change in size as they approach or move away, regardless of their actual shape.
5. The narrator promises to explain how Flatlanders distinguish between individuals despite their limitations in perception, but first intends to discuss the climate and architecture of Flatland.
